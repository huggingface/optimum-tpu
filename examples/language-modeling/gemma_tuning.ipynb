    "# Fine-Tune Gemma on Google TPU\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will teach how to fine-tune open LLMs like [Google Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b) on Google Cloud's TPUs. In our example, we are going to leverage Hugging Face Optimum TPU, [🤗 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and datasets.\n",

    "### Google's TPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Cloud TPUs are custom-designed AI accelerators, which are optimized for training and inference of large AI models. They are ideal for a variety of use cases, such as chatbots, code generation, media content generation, synthetic speech, vision services, recommendation engines, personalization models, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of using TPUs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designed to scale cost-efficiently for a wide range of AI workloads, spanning training, fine-tuning, and inference.\n",
    "* Optimized for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX, and are available in a variety of form factors, including edge devices, workstations, and cloud-based infrastructure.\n",
    "* TPUs are available in Google Cloud, and have been integrated with Vertex AI, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, a single-host `v5litepod8` TPU will be enough. To set up a TPU environment with Pytorch XLA, this [Google Cloud guide](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/run-calculation-pytorch) shows how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `ssh` or `gcloud` commands to log in to the remote TPU. Enable port-forwarding for the port `8888`, e.g.:"
