make test_installs
```

## Development Tools

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile with commands for various development tasks:

### Testing
```bash
make tests              # Run all tests
make tgi_test           # Run TGI tests with PyTorch/XLA
make tgi_test_jetstream # Run TGI tests with Jetstream backend
make tgi_docker_test    # Run TGI integration tests in Docker
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make style         # Auto-fix code style issues
make style_check   # Check code style without fixing
```

### Documentation
```bash
make preview_doc    # Preview documentation locally
```

### Docker Images
```bash
make tpu-tgi        # Build TGI Docker image
make tpu-tgi-ie     # Build TGI inference endpoint image
make tpu-tgi-gcp    # Build TGI Google Cloud image
```

### TGI Development
When working on Text Generation Inference (`/text-generation-inference` folder). You will also want to build TGI image from scratch, as discussed in the manual image building section of the [serving how to guide](./howto/serving)

1. Build the standalone server:
```bash
make tgi_server
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes

3. Run tests:
```bash
make tests 
# Run more specialized test if needed such as make tgi_test, make tgi_test_jetstream, make tgi_docker_test
make style_check
```

4. Submit your PR with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Test results
   - Documentation updates if needed

5. Check that the CI tests are correct:
    - Verify all CI workflows have passed
    - Address any CI failures
