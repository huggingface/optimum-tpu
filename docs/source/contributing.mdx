# Contributing to Optimum TPU

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to Optimum TPU! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or sharing your experiences, your contributions are highly valued ðŸ˜„

## Getting Started

1. [Fork](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-tpu/fork) and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/optimum-tpu.git
cd optimum-tpu
```

2. Install the package locally:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install . -f https://storage.googleapis.com/libtpu-releases/index.html
```

## Development Tools

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile with commands for various development tasks:

### Testing
```bash
make tests              # Run all the non-TGI-related tests
make tgi_test           # Run TGI tests with PyTorch/XLA
make tgi_test_jetstream # Run TGI tests with Jetstream backend
make tgi_docker_test    # Run TGI integration tests in Docker
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make style         # Auto-fix code style issues
make style_check   # Check code style without fixing
```

### Documentation
```bash
make preview_doc    # Preview documentation locally
```

### Docker Images
```bash
make tpu-tgi        # Build TGI Docker image
make tpu-tgi-ie     # Build TGI inference endpoint image
make tpu-tgi-gcp    # Build TGI Google Cloud image
```

### TGI Development
When working on Text Generation Inference (`/text-generation-inference` folder), you might also want to build a TGI image from scratch. To do this, refer to the manual image building section of the [serving how to guide](./howto/serving)

1. Build the standalone server:
```bash
make tgi_server
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes

3. Run tests:
```bash
make tests 
# Run more specialized test if needed such as make tgi_test, make tgi_test_jetstream, make tgi_docker_test
make style_check
```

4. Submit your PR with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Test results
   - Documentation updates if needed
