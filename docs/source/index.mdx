# ðŸ¤— Optimum TPU

<Tip>
If you are here to start using huggingface products on TPU, then you are in the right place!
</Tip>

Optimum TPU provides all the necessary machinery to leverage and optimize AI workloads running on [Google Cloud TPU devices](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs). Optimum-TPU is a Huggingface solution to optimize Huggingface products for the TPU platform. This allows users to use Huggingface features and easy-to-use libraries on TPU with the best performance. We currently optimize transformers and TGI and integrate [huggingface hub](https://huggingface.co/models) so you can access Huggingface's large library of models.

If you are here to start using huggingface products on TPU, then you are in the right place

The API provides the overall same user-experience as Hugging Face transformers with the minimum amount of changes required to target performance for inference and training.

Optimum TPU is meant to reduce as much as possible the friction in order to leverage Google Cloud TPU accelerators.
As such, we provide a pip installable package to make sure everyone can get easily started.
```bash
pip install optimum-tpu -f https://storage.googleapis.com/libtpu-releases/index.html
