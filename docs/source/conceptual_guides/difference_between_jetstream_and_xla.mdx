# Differences between JetStream and PyTorch XLA

| Feature | JetStream | PyTorch XLA |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Training | ❌ | ✅ |
| Serving | ✅ | ✅ |
| Performance | Higher serving performance | Standard performance |
| Flexibility | Limited to serving | Full PyTorch ecosystem |
| Use Case | Production inference | Development and training |
| Integration | Optimized for deployment | Standard PyTorch workflow |

**Notes:**
By default, optimum-tpu is using PyTorch XLA for training and JetStream for serving.
