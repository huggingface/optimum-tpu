# TPU hardware support
Optimum-TPU support and is optimized for v5e and v6e TPUs.

## TPU naming convention
The TPU naming follows this format: `<tpu_version>-<number_of_tpus>`

TPU version: 
- v5litepod (v5e)
- v6e

For example, a v5litepod-8 is a v5e TPU with 8 tpus.

## Memory on TPU
The HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) capacity per chip is 16GB for v5e, v5p and 32GB for v6e. So a v5e-8 (v5litepod-8), has 16GB*8=128GB of HBM memory

## Recommended Runtime for TPU

During the TPU VM creation use the following TPU VM base images for optimum-tpu:
- v2-alpha-tpuv6e (TPU v6e) (recommended)
- v2-alpha-tpuv5 (TPU v5p) (recommended)
- v2-alpha-tpuv5-lite (TPU v5e) (recommended)
- tpu-ubuntu2204-base (default)

For installation instructions, refer to our [TPU setup tutorial](../tutorials/tpu_setup). We recommend you use the *alpha* version with optimum-tpu, as optimum-tpu is tested and optimized for those.
