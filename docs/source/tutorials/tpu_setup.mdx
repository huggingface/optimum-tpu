# First TPU Setup on Google Cloud

This guide walks you through setting up and accessing your first TPU instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A Google Cloud account
- Billing enabled on your account
- Basic familiarity with cloud consoles

## Step 1: Enable TPU Access

1. Navigate to the TPU dashboard at: https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/tpus
   - Note: You will need to enable the TPU API if you haven't already
   - A valid billing account must be linked to your project

2. If prompted, enable the TPU API for your project

## Step 2: Create your TPU Instance

Click the "Create" button to setup your TPU instance.

### Region Selection

1. Review available regions and zones for TPUs: https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/regions-zones
2. For this example, we will use `us-west-4a` zone
   - Important: TPU availability may vary by region
   - Tips: Choose a region close to your primary usage location

### TPU Configuration

1. Select TPU type:
   - We will use a TPU `v5e-8` (corresponds to a v5litepod8). This is a TPU node containing 8 v5e TPU chips
   - For detailed specifications about TPU types, refer to our [TPU hardware types documentation](../conceptual_guides/tpu_hardware_support)
   
2. Choose a runtime:
   - Select `v2-alpha-tpuv5-lite` runtime
   - This runtime is optimized for TPU v5e
      - More runtime information on runtime can be found in at recommended runtime for TPU section in our [TPU hardware page](../conceptual_guides/tpu_hardware_support)

## Step 3: Access Your TPU

After creation, your TPU instance should be accessible by ssh

1. Access your TPU:
   - Click the SSH button in the console for immediate terminal access

2. For permanent SSH access:
   - Add your SSH keys following the guide at: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/add-ssh-keys
   - This enables more convenient access for future sessions
   - You can also look at the ssh section in our [guide about the gcloud cli](../howto/gcloud_cli)

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working TPU environment, you can start using it for AI workloads. We offer two main paths depending on your use case:
